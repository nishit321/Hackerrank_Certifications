//Algorithm Discussion on Problem 1

/* The below problem solving algorithm approach is mine ; it's upto a programmer how efficiently they can optimize the solution. */

/*
The first coding problem in my assessment test was about :
                                                        
                                                          Minimum swapping of strings
                                                          So we are dealing here with a medium string problem where we need to check within the pattern of string for no 
                                                          adjacent letter should be together and if found we need to swap . At the end we need to count the number of swap
                                                          happened within the string. 
                                                          A general approach was used that checking each letter with the adjacent letter and incrementing the swap_count value.
                                                          
                                                          I have solved this problem of time complexity O(n).
