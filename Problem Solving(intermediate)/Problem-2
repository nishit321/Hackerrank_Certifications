//Algorithm Discussion on Problem 2

/* The below problem solving algorithm approach is mine ; it's upto a programmer how efficiently they can optimize the solution. */

/*
The second coding problem in my assessment test was about :
                                                          
                                                         It was based on binary search algorithms. 
                                                         
                                                         The solution would be to sort the array in ascending order and then for each player 
                                                         find the next player with the least skill that satisfies the minimum criteria. 
                                                         Use binary search to find the next optimal player.
