*Problem Solving (Intermediate)*

**It covers topics of Data Structures (such as HashMaps, Stacks and Queues) and Algorithms (such as Optimal Solutions).**

Solving problems is the core of computer science. Programmers must first understand how a human solves a problem, then understand how to translate this "algorithm" into something a computer can do, and finally how to write the specific code to implement the solution. At its core, problem-solving focuses on the study, understanding, and usage of data structures and algorithms.
